## Benefits

- Extremely lightweight (less than 2KB minzipped).

- No other 3rd-party dependencies.
- The performance is excellent!

## Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import CustomScroller from 'react-custom-scroller';
import 'react-custom-scroller/dist/index.css';

const MyScrollableDiv = () => (
  <CustomScroller>Content goes here.</CustomScroller>
);
```
